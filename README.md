My Bachelor's Thesis project.

**Abstract**
> Making a decision on what to invest development time in is dif- ficult. Today’s market is so competitive that you cannot afford to focus on negligible product features. Based on reported customer behavior, I propose a ranking of the most important features with the help of statistics and machine learning. Following this advice leads to making informed decisions leading to good use of developers’ time.
